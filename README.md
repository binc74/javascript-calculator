Josh Wright: Provided a large part of the html and css styling. Implemented the mode bar buttons and the memory feature.
With the memory feature, you may save a "Stack" of values in memory. Addition and subtraction operations can be done on 
the value at the top of the memory stack. The mode button was added so we could offer multiple modes, but we were only 
able to implement the mode for a scientific calculator.
